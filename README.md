# Heart_Disease
I am using data science techniques like Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and prediction/ machine learning models to identify and predict the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
I am comparing KNN, Logistic regression, and Decision tree models to determine the most accurate model.
